An implementation to detect and decode Mode-S messages modulated on 1090MHz.

The implementation is implemented fully in Python (2.7.9), tested on raspberry pi 2 model B hardware
using an RTL-SDR USB dongle. Focus is on using Python idioms and readability, not optimizations.

The following message will be decoded:

* Short air-to-air surveillance (Downlink format: 0)
* Surveillance altitude reply (Downlink format: 4)
* Surveillande identity reply (Downlink format: 5)
* Long air-to-air surveillance (Downlink format: 16)
* ADS-B, Extended Squitter (Downlink format:17)
* Comm BDS altitude reply (Downlink format: 20)
* Comm BDS identity reply (Downlink format: 21)

Messages decoded are displayed either in a serialised format on standard output
or in a tabular format depending on preference. An inbuilt server is listening on port 5051 (configurable) and
enables a client to access decoded messages in json format.

Some statistics is collected, this data is also accessible through the server

To execute, simply try $ python radar.py
