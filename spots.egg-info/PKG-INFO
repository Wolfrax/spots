Description: An implementation to detect and decode Mode-S messages modulated on 1090MHz.
        
        The implementation is implemented fully in Python (2.7.9), tested on raspberry pi 2 model B hardware
        using an RTL-SDR USB dongle. Focus is on using Python idioms and readability, not optimizations.
        
        The following message will be decoded:
        
        * Short air-to-air surveillance (Downlink format: 0)
        * Surveillance altitude reply (Downlink format: 4)
        * Surveillande identity reply (Downlink format: 5)
        * Long air-to-air surveillance (Downlink format: 16)
        * ADS-B, Extended Squitter (Downlink format:17)
        * Comm BDS altitude reply (Downlink format: 20)
        * Comm BDS identity reply (Downlink format: 21)
        
        Messages decoded are displayed either in a serialised format on standard output
        or in a tabular format depending on preference. An inbuilt server is listening on port 5051 (configurable) and
        enables a client to access decoded messages in json format.
        
        Some statistics is collected, this data is also accessible through the server
        
        To execute, simply try $ python radar.py
